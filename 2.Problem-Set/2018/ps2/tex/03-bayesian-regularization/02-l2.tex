\item  \subquestionpoints{5} Recall that $L_2$ regularization penalizes the $L_2$ norm
of the parameters while minimizing the loss (\emph{i.e.,} negative log likelihood in case of
probabilistic models).
Now we will show that MAP estimation with a zero-mean
Gaussian prior over $\theta$, specifically $\theta \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \eta^2I)$,
is equivalent to applying $L_2$ regularization with MLE estimation. Specifically,
show that $$\theta_{\text{MAP}} = \arg\min_\theta - \log p(y|x,\theta) + \lambda||\theta||^2_2.$$
Also, what is the value of $\lambda$?
